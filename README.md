# AnimeDatabase-SA
Some C++ and Python calling to keep track of my anime library.
Essentially I tried to create a program to log every time a new anime is added to the list, what is added to the list
and allow the user to sort it. Some more functions like seeing the log is something that should either be added or will be.
